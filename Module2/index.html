			Usually we say “nice to meet you” after someone tells us their name. Or you can say “it was nice meeting you” when the conversation is finished and you are leaving.
			How’s it going?
			This is a casual way of asking “how are you?” You can use it with friends, but don’t use it in formal situations like a job interview. Great! Pretty good. It’s okay. Not bad. Can’t complain!
			What’s up?
			This is also a casual greeting, but it is a little different from “how’s it going”.</p>
